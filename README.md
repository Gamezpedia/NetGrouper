NetGrouper
==========

A wrapper for Actionscript 3.0's NetGroup and RTMFP Multicasting abilities to create quick P2P multiplayer games over local networks or Adobe Cirrus

The example project included shows you how to connect over a local network or Cirrus as well as how to post and receive messages. Library works best for applications meant to have less than 13 simultaneous realtime connections.

To see it in action, download the swf and run it multiple times at once, or upload it and run it on multiple devices on the same local network. Magical Realtime Goodness!
